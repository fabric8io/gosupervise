# Project Docs

Documentation for the project should be stored in the `_docs` directory.
Since the directory is protected from Go, undecorated code samples can
also be dropped inside of this directory.

We need to decide on whether we'll continue using RST or switch to
Markdown.

I believe we are leaning toward MkDocs: http://www.mkdocs.org/
